% is needed, as weel as  at least one BIPARTITE network model, that needs
% to be in the models folder.

% INPUT:

%       equity -->      Contains a vector of the equities of each investor.

%                       of al the assets present in the system.

%                       liquidity needs to be rescaled.
%               
%      sizes-->        A vector with the sizes of alll the banks if
%                       sizes
